# ScalaSpark

Exercises from [Apache Spark 2.0 with Scala](https://www.udemy.com/apache-spark-with-scala-hands-on-with-big-data).

My [notes](https://github.com/bryanesmith/notes/tree/master/Apache%20Spark%202.0%20with%20Scala) are in a different repo.

## Setup

Section 1 of my linked notes distill instructor's instructions on setup.

Note that while I'm using Intellij, I exclude project files from this repo. You are responsible for choosing and setting up your IDE.

Make sure you set `src/resources` as your resources root.
