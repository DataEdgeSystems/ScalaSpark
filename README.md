# ScalaSpark

Exercises from [Apache Spark 2.0 with Scala](https://www.udemy.com/apache-spark-with-scala-hands-on-with-big-data).

My [notes](https://github.com/bryanesmith/notes/tree/master/Apache%20Spark%202.0%20with%20Scala) are in a different repo.

## Setup

I'm using Intellij; however, I exclude project files.

Make sure you set `src/resources` as your resources root.
